# Social_media

Hi all!

This repo is my experiment with plot.ly to do visualization in Python for some social media contents. Below are info of each script.

* Univariate analysis.ipynd: Can users' comments predict a channel's subscription count? How do they correlate?
* pie_plot.ipynd: how are brands represented on Youtube vie Youtube search? How are views driven by different type of Youtube channel?
* comment_wordplot.ipynd: what do users say about each Youtube channel?
* Others: supporting scripts to call and save data

Best!
